## <mark>LinkedIn Employee Analysis</mark>
Data Analysis project designed for scraping company employee lists on LinkedIn. The core idea consists in building database structures from the extracted employee data, the latter being further used to fuel a series of analytical and statistical queries. 

> *Note*: the current implementation showcases a project demo that is to be further scaled. The afore-mentioned employee data has thus been extracted from **a single employer source**, making up only a small percentage of their actual enlisted staff.

### Run script: `python3 ./main.py`

*Data scraping flow*: data_extraction -> start_search -> get_experience
